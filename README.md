# Holiday-Gift-Exchange
A quick script to randomize a gift exchange and email all the participants so that nobody knows who everybody has.

Customizations that you need to make to use it:
1. Modify the names list
2. Modify the email list, should be in the same order as the names list.
3. Add your username to the backup_output_file_path
4. Add your email and pasword to the send_mail function.  Note: be careful, maybe just add your password, run, and then delete it without saving so that you don't have to store it in plain text.
5. Customize the subject and text strings for a customized email. (optional)
6. Add an image path to the 'im_path' field to attach and additional holiday greating. (optional)
